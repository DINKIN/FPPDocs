### Installation & Development

Dependencies are managed via Composer (PHP) & Node / NPM (front-end asset compilation, linting & versioning). You will need composer installed on your machine (https://getcomposer.org) as well as Node (https://nodejs.org/en/)

1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
2. Install php dependencies via composer by running ```composer install```
3. Install frontend dependencies and toolkits by running ```npm install```
4. Run ```gulp watch``` to watch filesystem for changes so frontend files are compiled.
